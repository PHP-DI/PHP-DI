                            Syntactic sugar in PHP-DI 5

                        <p>
                            It's been quite some time since there was a bit of news here. The reason is that a lot of work has been done for PHP-DI 5! It is not yet ready, but it is coming along great!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am not going to list everything that will be included in this next major version today. For now I'll simply give you a glimpse of the syntactic sugar that it will bring.

                            I am happy to announce that PHP-DI version 4.4 has been released.
                            This version contains mainly improvements to the <code>Container::call()</code> feature, and contains no BC-break.

                            PHP 5.6 has been released a month ago and PHP-DI just got better because of it!

                            As explained 9 months ago when I introduced the new definition format for PHP-DI 4,
                            that format has been thought for the future.

                            This version contains features that have all been
                            implemented by contributors other than me, this is very encouraging :)
                            This is also the quickest release, since 4.2 was released only 14 days ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It comes without any BC break, and with a new main feature: <code>DI\env()</code>
                            to import <strong>environment variables</strong>.

                            This is a new major release, and it delivers. As indicated by "major release",
                            it comes with BC breaks, but this is for the better.

                            Autowiring and Annotations are still there, but the YAML
                            and PHP array definitions have disappeared. Let's see why.
