# Autowiring

*Autowiring* is an exotic word that represents something very simple: **the ability of the container to automatically create and inject dependencies**.

In order to achieve that, PHP-DI uses [PHP's reflection](http://php.net/manual/book.reflection.php) to detect what parameters a constructor needs.

Let's take this example:

```php
class UserRepository
{
    // ...
}

class UserRegistrationService
{
    public function __construct(UserRepository $repository)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

When PHP-DI needs to create the `UserRegistrationService`, it detects that the constructor takes a `UserRepository` object (using the [type hinting](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.typehinting.php)).

**Without any configuration**, PHP-DI will create a `UserRepository` instance (if it wasn't already created) and pass it as a constructor parameter. The equivalent raw PHP code would be:

```php
$repository = new UserRepository();
$service = new UserRegistrationService($repository);
```

As you can imagine, it's very simple, doesn't require any configuration, and it just works!

## Configuration

**Autowiring is enabled by default.** You can disable it using the container builder:

```php
$containerBuilder->useAutowiring(false);
```

## Limitations

PHP-DI won't be able to resolve cases like this:

```php
class Database
{
    public function __construct($dbHost, $dbPort)
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function setLogger(LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

- it will not know what parameters to give to the constructor (since there is no type-hinting for an object)
- `setLogger()` will not be called

For those classes, you will need to use [PHP definitions](php-definitions.md) to declare explicitly what to inject.
