# Migrating from PHP-DI 5.x to 6.0

PHP-DI 6.0 is a new major version that comes with backward compatibility breaks.

This guide will help you migrate from a 5.x version to 6.0. It will only explain backward compatibility breaks, it will not present the new features (read the release notes or the blog post for that).

## PHP version

PHP-DI requires PHP 7 or greater, it is no longer compatible with PHP 5.

As a consequence if you require `ocramius/proxy-manager` in your project (to benefit from [lazy injection](../lazy-injection.md)), you must require v2.0 (not 1.0, which is not compatible with PHP 7).

## Definitions

### DI\object()

The `DI\object()` function helper has been removed. You should use `DI\create()` or `DI\autowire()` instead.

**What should you do with your `DI\object()` definitions:**

- if you disabled autowiring:
    - replace it with `DI\create()` and everything should work
- if you use autowiring:
    - replace it with `DI\create()` for definitions that replace autowiring completely (i.e. those that redefine all the parameters)
    - replace it with `DI\autowire()` for definitions that just define *some* parameters and let autowiring guess the rest of the parameters

If you have a single configuration file, that's it.

If you have multiple configuration files, for example if you have built a module system, then there is one thing to be aware of: `DI\object()` used to *extend* previous definitions. `create()` and `autowire()` do not extend previous definitions, they completely override them, and this is intended. The behavior of `object()` was confusing and hard to understand, the new helpers are more predictable and simple.

### DI\link()

The `DI\link()` function helper was deprecated in 5.0. It is now completely removed. Use `DI\get()` instead.

## Caching

PHP-DI 5 was using the Doctrine Cache library for caching definitions. Since then, PSR-6 and PSR-16 have standardized caching in PHP.

PHP-DI 6 now uses PSR-16 (the simple cache standard) instead of Doctrine. The migration should be easy:

- you can replace completely doctrine/cache with another PHP library, like the [symfony/cache](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html) component

    ```php
    $cache = new Symfony\Component\Cache\Simple\ApcuCache();
    $containerBuilder->setDefinitionCache($cache);
    ```

- or else you can use the `Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\DoctrineAdapter` class from the [symfony/cache](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html) component to keep using the Doctrine cache while also making it compatible with PSR-16

    ```php
    $doctrineCache = /* your current Doctrine cache */
    $cache = new Symfony\Component\Cache\Adapter\DoctrineAdapter($doctrineCache);
    $containerBuilder->setDefinitionCache($cache);
    ```

## Internal changes

If you were overriding or extending some internal classes of PHP-DI, be aware that they may have changed.
