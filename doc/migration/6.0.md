# Migrating from PHP-DI 5.x to 6.0

PHP-DI 6.0 is a new major version that comes with backward compatibility breaks.

This guide will help you migrate from a 5.x version to 6.0. It will only explain backward compatibility breaks, it will not present the new features (read the release notes or the blog post for that).

## Definitions

### DI\link()

The `DI\link()` function helper was deprecated in 5.0. It is now completely removed. Use `DI\get()` instead.

## Internal changes

If you were overriding or extending some internal classes of PHP-DI, be aware that they may have changed.
